# Daily Focus Dashboard

**Type:** Global Plugin

A workspace-wide task dashboard that aggregates tasks from across your entire Thymer workspace. Operates in two modes — **Focus** for executing your day, **Plan** for deciding what matters.

## Modes

### Focus

Shows what you're working on today, organized by time.

- **Unscheduled** — tasks pinned to today or scheduled for today without a time block
- **Day Plan** — time slots from Early Morning through Evening; tap a task then a slot (or vice versa) to assign it

Navigate to past or future days with `←` / `→`. Future days show a dimmed preview of tasks that would recur on that day. Switch to Plan with the **Plan →** button.

### Plan

Used to decide what goes into your day.

- **Overdue** — tasks past their due date, highlighted in red
- **Today's Focus** — tasks pinned for today
- **Inbox** — all undated todos; use **Hide/Show recurring** to filter recurring tasks out

Tap a task in Overdue or Inbox to pin it to Today's Focus. Remove it with `×`. Navigate forward to future dates with `←` / `→`. Switch back with **← Focus**.

### Recurring tasks *(experimental)*

Accessible via the ☰ menu. Lists all tasks marked as recurring. Tap a row to expand and set its schedule — choose a frequency (daily / weekly / monthly / yearly) and, where applicable, a day. Remove the recurring setting via the trash icon.

### Ignore list

Accessible via the ☰ menu. Hide tasks from Plan and Focus without deleting them. Ignored tasks are listed separately and can be restored at any time with a single click.

## Menu

A hamburger menu (☰) sits in the top left corner of every view:

- **Focus** — switch to Focus mode
- **Plan** — switch to Plan mode
- **Recurring tasks** — manage recurring schedules
- **Ignore list** — hide tasks from Plan and Focus

## Task interactions

- **Checkbox** — mark a task done (or undo from the done state). Done tasks appear with strikethrough and reduced opacity.
- **Repeat icon** — mark a task as recurring or remove its recurring schedule.
- **Source name / ↗ icon** — navigates directly to the task in its source document, scrolling to and highlighting it.
- **× button** — unpin from Today's Focus or remove from a time block.
- **Task text** (Focus mode) — tap to select a task, then tap a time block to assign it; tap again to deselect.

The dashboard refreshes automatically when tasks are created, updated, or completed elsewhere in the workspace.
